# time-series-guide
Repository to be a self-study guide into the world of time series analysis.

## References

The two books that will be our major references are:

[Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/)

[Applied Time Series Analysis](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510/lesson/1)

## Lesson 1

The first step of any time series analysis is going to be a data exploration to understand aspects of data such as:
 - Is there a trend in our series?
 - Is there a seasonal aspect in our data?
 - Outliers, missing values, any data transformation required?
 - Is there a cycle?
 - Variance seems to change over time?
 - Is there any abrupt changes in our time series process generation?
 
 This kind of question and many others are essential to build an extensive understaing of your dataset.
 
 The major chapters references for our first lesson will be:
 
 [Chapters 1, 2, 3 - FPP] (https://otexts.com/fpp2/intro.html)
 [Time Series Basics] (https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510/lesson/1)
 
 Your goal will be to explore the four datasets in the ``` data/raw/ ``` directory:
  - daily-total-female-births.csv
  - arrivals.csv
  - Electric_Production.csv
  - google_stock.csv
  
 Try to plot and learn basic of preprocessing time series data. An excellent reference is [Tom Augspuerger post about time series analysis](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-7-timeseries)
